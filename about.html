      <h2>About BeMoreSmart</h2>

      <p>
        BeMoreSmart is a curated learning library built for long-term use.
      </p>

      <p>
        It exists to solve a simple problem: finding good learning resources once —
        and not having to search for them again.
      </p>

      <p>
        Instead of chasing algorithms, trends, or endless recommendations,
        BeMoreSmart focuses on collecting high-quality resources and organising
        them in a way that supports sustained, independent learning.
      </p>

      <p>
        This site is intentionally quiet, static, and distraction-free.
      </p>

      <h3>What this site is</h3>

      <p>
        BeMoreSmart is a reference library, not a course.
        It’s a starting point rather than a complete curriculum,
        and a personal knowledge archive designed to be revisited over months or years.
      </p>

      <p>
        Resources are grouped by topic and discipline so you can save progress,
        return later without losing context, and explore new areas without overwhelm.
      </p>

      <p>
        You are meant to dip in, step away, and come back.
      </p>

      <h3>What this site is not</h3>

      <p>
        BeMoreSmart is not a replacement for formal education,
        not a promise that every resource is “the best,”
        and not a platform optimised for speed-running knowledge.
      </p>

      <p>
        Learning takes time. This site respects that.
      </p>

      <h3>How resources are chosen</h3>

      <p>
        Resources are selected for clarity over hype,
        depth over virality, and usefulness for long-term learners.
      </p>

      <p>
        Many links point to playlists, series, or creators that reward consistency
        rather than quick wins. Nothing on this site is autogenerated.
      </p>

      <h3>How to use this site effectively</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>Bookmark topics you’re actively studying</li>
        <li>Save individual resources you want to return to</li>
        <li>Avoid opening everything at once — this is a library, not a checklist</li>
        <li>Let interests rotate naturally over time</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Progress doesn’t have to be visible to be real.
      </p>

      <h3>A note on maintenance</h3>

      <p>
        BeMoreSmart is designed to be left alone.
      </p>

      <p>
        It does not need constant updates to remain useful.
        New resources may be added occasionally, but stability matters more than freshness.
      </p>

      <h3>Credits</h3>

      <p>
        Built and curated by a learner, for learners.
